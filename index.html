			<h2  id="HM">WHAT WE DO</h2>
		   <strong>ENDING POVERTY:</strong>
		   <br>
		   <strong>WOOKIE FOUNDATION</strong> is a global movement of people, working together to end the injustice of poverty. Working with partners, 
			we use a combination of practical tactics and innovation to deliver development programs, public education, campaigns, advocacy
			and humanitarian assistance in disasters and conflicts. From sanitation and clean water to getting more kids into school, we 
			won’t stop until every person on the planet can enjoy life free from poverty. Find out more about the issues we work on.
		   <p><strong>WATER AND SANITATION:</strong><br>
			Water is central to almost every aspect of <strong>WOOKIE FOUNDATION</strong> work: our humanitarian responses, our campaigns, and our long-term initiatives to help families
			improve their incomes, reduce their vulnerability to disasters, and defend their rights.Our work means ensuring equitable access to water in both quantity 
			and quality, which prevents disease and sustains lives and livelihoods; reducing environmental health risks by managing sanitation safely and with dignity; 
			and, involving women and men in managing water and sanitation resources and safe hygiene practices to maximize the benefits for their communities.</p>
		   <p><strong>FOOD,CLIMATE AND NATURAL RESOURCES:</strong><br>
			 Almost a billion of people go to bed hungry every night. Not because there isn't enough food for everyone, but because of the deep injustice in the way food is
			 produced and accessed. Increasing corporate power in food production, the climate crisis and unfair access to natural resources impact on people’s ability
			 to grow and buy food. They are particularly harmful for women, who work in agriculture more than any other sector and produce much of the world’s food.
			 <strong>WOOKIE FOUNDATION:</strong> wants to erradicate hunger with joint effort</p>
		   <p><strong>CONFLICTS AND DISASTERS</strong><br>
			 Every year since 2008, the world has become less peaceful. From climate-related disasters to long-lasting conflicts and insecurity, we witnessed a rise
			 in the scale and frequency of humanitarian crises, increasing the number of vulnerable people, displaced, at risk or in need of assistance.In Syria, Yemen or
			 South Sudan, conflicts continue to threaten and destroy the lives of millions of women, men and children, trapping them in a vicious cycleof violence, poverty and
			 inequality. Hunger is again on the rise, reversing years of progress.The number of climate-related disasters has tripled in 30 years, causing harm and suffering to 
			 communities across the globe. By the 2030s, large parts of Southern, Eastern and the Horn of Africa and South and East Asia will experience greater exposure to droughts,
			 floods and tropical storms.</p>
		   <p><strong>EXTREME INEQUALITY AND ESSENTIAL SEVICE:</strong><br>
			Our economy is broken. From most AFRICA country mostly and KOREA AMERICA e.t.c, absurd levels of wealth exist alongside desperate poverty. Since 2015, the richest 1% has 
			owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. In countries around the world, a small elite are taking an ever-increasing share of their nation’s income, while hundreds of 
			millions of people are still living without access to clean water and without enough food to feed their families.Extreme inequality is hurting us all, but it is the poorest
			people who suffer most especially women and girls. No matter how hard they work, far too many suffer the indignity of poverty wages and are denied basic rights. In many 
			countries a decent education or quality healthcare has become a luxury only the rich can afford.</p>
